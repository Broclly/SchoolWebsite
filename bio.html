            <h2 id="earlyLife"> Early Life</h2>
            <blockquote> 
                <p> Joshua was born on November 10th, 2008. As a toddler, Joshua was a very quiet child
                and was not very aggressive, and rather unintelligent. During these early phases of life
                Joshua was introducded to the magics of the world known as science and engineering. He 
                enjoyed watching shows such as mighty machines, and the Magic School Bus. Bewildered and amazed
                by the beauty of the world, a starry-eyed Joshua quickly obtained an interest in science. 
                Alongside usual child activities such as playing with toys, Joshua enjoyed learning about the periodic
                table, for which he fell in love with the element Xenon, a favourite that still pertains to this day.
                <br>
                <br>
                On one fateful day when Joshua was 6, he went on his scooter. Although this seemed like a normal thing
                for a child to do, things quickly went awry when he fell off his scooter after being distracted by a cat.
                Breaking his fall with his wrist, he broke his arm, and resulted in a trip to the hospital. Joshua stayed in
                said hosptial for 3 days before being discharged, after he had surgery and 2 different casts applied to him.
                IT was quite a nightmere, as he had to get 3 screws added for the surgery, only to have them be removed
                a couple weeks later. When the dust had settled, and all incredibly painful processes were done, Joshua
                had recovered, and kept a story for a lifetime.
                <br>
                <br>
                By the time he was around 7, Joshua met his first nemesis; His sister. Someone who was quickly annoyed,
                while Joshua was someone who found annoying others entertaining, watching them get frusterated.
                His sister, who's name is Zoe, was a rather imaginative and creative sibling, who enjoyed painting, and crafts.
                Although he tried many times, Joshua never saw an interest in creativity when he was young. Around this time,
                Joshua also got along with a more reckless individual from up north in Sudbury. His cousin, Randy, was
                a great pal, and he matched the surplus energy that Joshua had constantly exhibited. This sudden explosive
                in energy allowed for them to enjoy great adventures and memories together. For a while, Randy would come
                annaully to stay for 2 weeks, but after the 4th year, Randy did not return.

            <blockquote>
                At age 10, Joshua's love for science blossomed into a passion for everything science related. This, in turn
                with his enjoyment of video games sparked an interest in coding and programming. While Joshua learned the ability
                to make markup files, and create websites, his curosity in the wide cosmos was slowly approaching. He deeply desired
                the need to explore and learn all about space. It became his favourite thing to think about. About space, 
                about the mysteries that lurked within, about the undiscovered beauties of the universe. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Stuff started kicking off around 13 years of age. Joshua's interests were still nominal and apparent, but he spent most
                of his time during the pandemic that had recently appeared on video games and squeezing out every social interaction
                he could. Finally, he felt that he fit in with a group of friends that liked to hangout with each other. But something
                else was lurking around the corner, a feeling that Joshua hadn't felt in a while. Panic. During Joshua's childhood, he often
                worried about the inevitability of fatality, as many do. And for some reason, it seemed this issue was coming back.
                This caused an extreme case of anexiety that caught Joshua by suprise. Mistaking it for illness, he quickly had a panic attack,
                which would take another year to go away.
                <br>
                <br>
                And now, we are at the present. Who knows what is next to come for Joshua? Only time will tell...
